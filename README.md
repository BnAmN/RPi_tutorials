# RPi Tutorials

alex-s

## Description

You will find inside this repository tutorials I wrote down while experimenting and working on the Raspberry Pi.
Those tutorials are not aimed at hardcore developpers (which I am not) but at technicians, artists or RPi enthusiasts.
I hope they will be useful to anyone who, like me, try to use the RPi for any artistic or creative purpose they have on their mind!

## What's inside?

Each folder of this repository is a tutorial. 
Every time you will find a README containing the actual tutorial and other files containing the codes that go with it.
